### Project Goal

Build a **custom & responsive** webpage to display project progress / status to relevant stakeholders.

### About this project
This project was conceived to meet a specific customer requirement to create a dashboard and display project progress. To start with, a simple dashboard was created using a spreadsheet. Over time, it became cumbersome to manage the spreadsheet and so there was a need to present project status in a better and managable way to support different form factors. This project is an incremental development activity, a part of which was taken up and completed by students during their internship period. 

### How to use this project?
Clone the repository / copy the zip folder and extract it's contents into a folder and launch the html file. If the sample data file `card-details.json` is in a different directory, the correct path should be provided in the associated javascript file.
